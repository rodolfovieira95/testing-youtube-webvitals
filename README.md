# Youtube iframe SEO testing.

The main idea of this repo was to test the easiest and best solution for Youtube iframe in a website to avoid being a detractor of the web vitals.

## react-lite-youtube-embed

Fortunetly I found the [react-lite-youtube-embed](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-lite-youtube-embed) developed by ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· [Ibrahim Cesar](https://github.com/ibrahimcesar). In a use case that I worked on it reduced the TBT (Total Blocking Time) in 2 seconds. The implementation was simple and allows us to customize as we wanted.
